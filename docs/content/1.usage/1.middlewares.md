# Middlewares

- In order to protect your routes, you can use the `authenticated` middleware that comes with the layer.
- If you wanna avoid a user to enter a route if he's already logged-in, you can use the `unauthenticated` middleware.

## Example

```vue [~/pages/protected.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
    middleware: 'authenticated'
})
</script>

<template>
    <!-- ... -->
</template>
```
