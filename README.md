# Supauth for Nuxt

Nuxt Layer with all you need to start your next Nuxt + Supabase project without having to worry about the auth system.

ðŸš§ This layer is still an experiment that will have many changes in the future, but feel free to try it and suggest changes or report problems.

## Features

-   Sign up with email and password
-   Sign in with providers
-   Auth middlewares

This layer is based on the [oxecore](https://github.com/imlautaro/oxecore) layer which includes the UnoCSS, Nuxt-Icon and VueUse modules by default, although you can expect that in the future it will not have dependencies that alter your project outside of the login screens.

## To do

-   Add magic-link login
-   Internationalization
-   Reset password page

## Setup

```bash
npm i -D supauth # yarn add -D supauth
```

```tsx
// ~~/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
	extends: ['supauth'],
})
```

## Modules Preset

-   Supabase
-   UnoCSS\*
-   Nuxt Icon\*
-   VueUse\*

\*coming from [oxecore](https://github.com/imlautaro/oxecore) layer

## Usage

To start using this layer, just follow the setup instructions and create a .env file with your Supabase credentials:

```tsx
// .env
SUPABASE_KEY=
SUPABASE_URL=
```

Then, you can run your project and go to /login to sign in or /register to create a new user.

Since this layer is using the `@nuxtjs/supabase` module, you can of course use all the functions and utilities coming from that module (`useSupabaseClient`, `useSupabaseUser`, etc).

### Options

```tsx
export default defineAppConfig({
	supauth: {
		confirm: true, // enable if you have email confirmation on
		redirect: '/', // the path you want to redirect your users after login
		providers: ['google', 'github'], // the oauth providers you want to enable
		legalAdvice: {
			privacy: '/privacy-policy',
			terms: '/terms-and-conditions',
		}, // legal links to show below the auth forms. you can set it to false to don't show any legal advice
	},
})
```

### Middlewares

-   authenticated (if there isnâ€™t a user logged-in, youâ€™re gonna be redirected to /login)
-   unauthenticated (if there is a user logged-in, youâ€™re gonna be redirected to /, or the redirect path in the options of the layer.
